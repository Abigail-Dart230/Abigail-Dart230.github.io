        <h1><strong>In The Rain</strong></h1>
        <p>Today, I think I will dance in the rain<br>Despite the harsh freezing droplets falling onto my skin<br>I will dance until I can no longer</p>
        <p>Today, I think I will sing in the rain<br>Despite the loud thunder in the distance overshadowing me <br>I will sing until my voice is gone</p>
        <p>Today, I think I will love in the rain<br>Despite the warmth of the house calling our names<br>The warmth of your hand in mine is all I need</p>
        <p>And it is all I will ever need</p>
        <p><em>Fin.</em></p>
